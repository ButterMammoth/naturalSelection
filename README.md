# naturalSelection
A short experiment/project on natural selection.

This code (run in the Processing development environment) generates a simulation which tries to recreate the process of natural selection.
There are creatures, food, and predators. The relationships between these objects are described in the file "PROCESS.md".
Use the config file to modify global variables and settings thus changing the simulation.
All the files are commented where necessary (and possible).

This program is free to use, modify or improve.
