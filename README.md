# naturalSelection
A short experiment/project on natural selection.

While watching random videos on the Internet, I was at first intrigued by some experiments people were doing, trying to simulate natural selection in a program. I decided I should give it a shot.
I will be designing my own methods and techniques to accomplish some sort of natural selection simulation and will, obviously, publish everything here on GitHub.
